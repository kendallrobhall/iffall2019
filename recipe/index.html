			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 1/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour</li>
				<li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
				<li>1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
				<li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
				<li>1/8 cup sugar</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon vanilla</li>
				<li>2 tablespoon honey</li>
				<li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
				<li>1/8 cup sugar</li>
				<li>3/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Line two baking sheets with a silpat or parchment paper.<br>
				<li>In the bowl of a food processor add the whole wheat flour, flour, baking soda, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon. <br>
				<li>Pulse to combine. Then add in 1/3 cup coconut oil, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup sugar, vanilla, and honey.<br>
				<li>Process until the dough looks like small peas, then add in the buttermilk and process until a dough ball forms.<br>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees<br>
				<li>Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and pinch any crumbles of dough together with your hands. Divide the dough into two flat disks. <br>
				<li>Working with one piece of dough at a time place a piece of wax paper over the dough and roll the dough as thin as you can, no thicker than an inch thick, but preferably a 1/8 inch thick (about the thickness of a quarter). <br>
				<li>Remove the top piece of parchment paper.<br>
				<li>In a small bowl combine the 1/8 cup sugar and 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon. In another bowl melt the remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil in the microwave. <br>
				<li>Brush the whole sheet of dough with the melted coconut oil and then generously sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.<br>
				<li>With a pastry cutter, pizza cutter or very sharp knife, even the edges of the rectangle. Slice into pieces, about 1/2 inch squares. <br>
				<li>Pierce each square carefully 2 or 3 with a fork. <br>
				<li>Use a very thin spatula and scrape the squares off the counter and then carefully use your hands to place the squares on the prepared baking sheets.<br>
				<li>Repeat with the remaining dough until all the dough has been used.
				Bake for 9 to 13 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top.<br>
				<li>Allow to cool completely and store in an airtight container.<br>
