				Quote 1
			</h2>
			<p>
				On quote 1, I suggested for Kirsten to use a slight drop shadow to make the text more legible, and to add the person<br>
				quoted in white text to the bottom right corner. I also suggested changing the desktop version from four to five lines.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Quote 2
			</h2>
			<p>
				On the second quote, I suggested to let the quote run past the width of the figures arms. I also suggested<br>
				increasing the image contrast and slightly decreasing the brightness, or adding a drop box behind the text,<br> 
				as it's difficult to see over the light grey suit. Also, I suggested trying to center the text.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Quote 3
			</h2>
			<p>
				I thought that this one was the most successful. The white over the brown is easily legible. My only suggestion<br>
				was to lower text size a little and bring the text box up and to the right by a few pixels.
