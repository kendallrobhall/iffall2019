		<p>Pure unadulterated sourdough taste. The BEST sourdough bread brand, possibly ever.</p><br>
		<br>
		<p><emphasize>About:</emphasize> THE ORIGINAL SAN FRANCISCO SOURDOUGH™ In 1849, Isidore Boudin struck gold with four simple ingredients: flour, water, salt, and mother dough. See how San Francisco’s history is baked into every bite. Our secret is in our mother dough—a magical combination formed by local varieties of wild yeast and lactobacillus—plus a few other helpful microbes—to create a natural source of fermentation that allows Boudin sourdough to rise without using commercial yeast. The key ingredient in our sourdough since 1849, she thrives only in the fog-cooled climate of San Francisco. Our mother dough imparts the famous Boudin flavor and texture unlike any other bread in the world.
