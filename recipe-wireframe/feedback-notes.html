Notes from Griffin Orser<br>
<ul>
<li>Increase header size
<li>Make all headers the same size
<li>Increase size of falling cereal image, maybe make background
<li>Increase weight of numbers in instructions
</ul>
<div>
I plan to include all of these changes in my final design. Specifically, Iâ€™m going to try a few methods to make the headers stand out more, because right now they blend in with the running text.
